Community node for **n8n** to interact with **Medusa**. It lets you automate
Medusa directly from your n8n workflows using a secure stored credential.

> ✅ **Verified community node** — installable directly from the n8n node panel
> (self-hosted **and** n8n Cloud).

## Installation

This is a **verified** community node: in n8n click **+ (Add node)**, search for
**Medusa**, and add it — no manual install needed.

<details>
<summary>Manual install (older n8n, or as an unverified package)</summary>

Go to **Settings → Community Nodes → Install** and enter `n8n-nodes-medusa`.

## Operations

| Operation | Description |
|---|---|
| **Get Config** | Get the configuration |
| **Get Series** | Get many series |
| **Get Stats** | Get statistics |

## Authentication

This node uses the **Medusa API** credential. In n8n, go to **Credentials → New**, pick
**Medusa API**, and fill in:

- **Base URL** — the address of your instance, e.g. `http://medusa:8081` (no trailing slash).
- **API Key** — your service API key.

Your credential is sent as the `X-Api-Key` request header.

**Where to find it:** See the service documentation: https://github.com/pymedusa/Medusa/wiki

The credential's **Test** button verifies the connection before you save.

## Usage

1. Add the **Medusa** node to a workflow (after a trigger such as *When clicking 'Test workflow'* or a Schedule Trigger).
2. Select your **Medusa API** credential.
3. Pick an **Operation** and run the workflow — the response is returned as JSON for the next node.

## Compatibility

Requires n8n **1.0** or newer. Built and linted with the official `@n8n/node-cli`, and
published to npm with a build-provenance attestation.
